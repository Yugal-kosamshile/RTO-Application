# Day 78: Create a Simple To-Do List Application

## 📝 Description

On Day 78 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I created a simple To-Do List application using Java and the Swing library. This application allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and remove tasks from the list.

### **Objective:**
- Develop a basic GUI application for managing tasks.
- Practice using Java Swing components to create interactive lists.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Provides a GUI for adding, completing, and removing tasks.
2. Uses `JList` to display the list of tasks and `JButton`s for managing tasks.
3. Implements event handling to perform add, remove, and mark-complete actions.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Java Swing for GUI development.
- Event handling for interactive components.
- Managing and updating a list of tasks.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 78/`
  - `ToDoListApp.java`: Java program for the To-Do List application.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac ToDoListApp.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java ToDoListApp
   ```

## 🔍 Example Usage

- **Add tasks** to the list by typing in the text field and clicking "Add Task."
- **Remove selected tasks** by selecting the task and clicking "Remove Task."
- **Mark tasks as complete** by selecting the task and clicking "Mark Complete," which updates the task with a strike-through.
